# EM-for-Factor-Analysis
This repo contains the sequential version and parallel version (Hadoop implementation) of Expectation Maximization algorithm for trainning Factor Analysis model.  

Please visit http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~mwmak/papers/FA-Ivector.pdf for the lecture notes on EM algorithm and Factor Analysis, provided by my supervisor, Professor M.W.MAK. 

The program logic is referred from EM for GMM project, written by Professor MAK, available at https://github.com/enmwmak/GMM-on-Hadoop.  

Run this project by ./run_FA.sh  
Input data could be generated from FADataGenerator.java
